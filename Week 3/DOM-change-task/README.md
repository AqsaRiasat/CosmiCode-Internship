DOM Manipulation Project

About: 

This is a small JavaScript project I made during my internship.
It shows how to change text and style dynamically using the DOM (Document Object Model).

How It Works:

There is a box with the message:
"Welcome, Guest! Click the button to continue."

When you click the button, the message changes to:
"ðŸŽ‰ Hello Aqsa! You just updated this using JavaScript DOM manipulation."

The box color, font size, and shadow also change.

Technologies Used:

HTML â€“ for the structure

CSS â€“ for styling

JavaScript â€“ for changing content and style dynamically

Why I Made This:

I created this project to practice basic DOM manipulation and to understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS.
