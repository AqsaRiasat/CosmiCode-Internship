My To-Do App 📝
Hi!
This is a simple To-Do List App I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It lets you:

Add tasks

Mark tasks as completed (just click the task)

Delete tasks

Filter tasks (All, Completed, Pending)

Clear all tasks at once

Save tasks in localStorage so they don’t disappear when you refresh

How to Use
Open index.html in your browser

Type a task and click Add

Click on any task to mark it done

Use the filter buttons to see All, Completed, or Pending tasks

Click Delete to remove a task

Click Clear All to remove everything

Why I Made This?
I built this project to practice:

JavaScript DOM manipulation

Working with events

Saving data in localStorage

Making a simple UI with CSS

That’s it! 😊
If you want to add Dark Mode, I already added the code for it—you just need to toggle the .dark class.

Let me know if you want help with that!
