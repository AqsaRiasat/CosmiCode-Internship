My Registration Form Project

This is a simple Registration Form project I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The main idea is to collect the user's Full Name, Email, Password, and Confirm Password, and make sure all inputs are properly validated.

What Did I Learn?
How to build forms using HTML

How to style them nicely with CSS

How to validate user inputs with JavaScript

How to display helpful error messages when something's wrong

How Does It Look?
The form is displayed inside a card-style box with a light gradient background.
When you focus on an input field, the border color changes.
When you hover over the Submit button, it has a smooth animation effect.

Tech Stack I Used:
HTML5 â€“ For the form structure

CSS3 â€“ For styling and making it look good

JavaScript â€“ For the validation logic

How Validation Works:
Field	Rule
Full Name	Cannot be empty
Email	Should be in correct format
Password	At least 6 characters long
Confirm Password	Must match the password entered

If any of these conditions arenâ€™t met, error messages appear right below the respective field.

How to Run This Project?
Download or clone the project files

Open index.html in any modern browser

Fill out the form and click Submit

If everything is correct, youâ€™ll see a success alert! If not, youâ€™ll see friendly error messages

What Can You Do Next?
Connect this form to a backend server (PHP, Node.js, etc.)

Add more fields like phone number, address, etc.

Make it even more stylish with animations or extra design elements.
