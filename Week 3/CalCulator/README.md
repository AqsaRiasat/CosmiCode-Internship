Modern Calculator

About:

This is a basic modern calculator I created for practice during my internship.
It allows you to perform simple arithmetic operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

Features:
Two input fields for numbers

Four operation buttons: + - × ÷

Real-time result display

Stylish UI with gradient backgrounds and smooth button effects

Technologies Used:
HTML – for the structure

CSS – for modern and glassy design

JavaScript – for the calculator logic

How to Use:
Enter the first number and second number in the input fields.

Click any of the operation buttons (+, -, ×, ÷).

The result will appear below the buttons.

If you try to divide by zero, it will show an error message.

Purpose:
This project is part of my learning journey.
I made it simple but visually modern to practice both design and functionality.
