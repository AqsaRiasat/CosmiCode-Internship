# ðŸŒ¿ Nature Image Slider

This is a simple and responsive image slider project created as part of my internship task. The slider showcases a collection of beautiful nature images with smooth transitions and navigation controls. Users can switch between slides using the previous/next arrows or directly through the navigation dots below the gallery.

## Project Purpose

The main goal of this project was to create a dynamic, visually appealing image gallery using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” without using any external libraries or frameworks. It highlights my ability to work with DOM manipulation, interactive UI elements, transitions, and responsive layouts.

##  Features

- Displays 4 full-width nature images in a slider
- Slide counter and caption text on each slide
- Previous and Next buttons to move between slides
- Navigation dots to jump to a specific image
- Smooth transition effects
- Responsive design with modern UI (shadows, blur effects, gradient backgrounds)

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** â€“ for the page and image structure
- **CSS3** â€“ for layout, transitions, gradients, and button styles
- **Vanilla JavaScript** â€“ for slider logic, navigation, and dynamic class switching

## File Structure

index.html â†’ Contains image slider structure
style.css â†’ Styles the slider, transitions, layout
script.js â†’ Controls image switching and interactivity


##  How It Works

- Initially, the first image is shown with a caption and counter.
- JavaScript handles switching between slides using:
  - Left/Right arrow buttons
  - Bottom navigation dots
- Only one image is visible at a time using the `active-slide` class.
- Active dot is highlighted to match the current slide.
