# JavaScript Events Practice

This is a simple front-end project built as part of my internship task. It demonstrates how different JavaScript events can be handled and interacted with in real time. The project includes examples of mouseover, focus/blur, and keypress events, each applied to form elements with live feedback.

##  Project Purpose

The goal of this task was to practice handling basic user interactions using **JavaScript Event Listeners**. It shows how changes in input or user behavior can be captured and reflected immediately on the web page without reloading.

## Features

- **Mouseover Event:** A button changes its text and background color when hovered and reverts when the mouse leaves.
- **Focus & Blur Event:** An input field changes its background color when selected and returns to default on blur (when focus is lost).
- **Keypress Event:** A live message appears below the input showing which key was pressed.

##  Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of the page  
- **CSS3** – Styling the form and interactive components  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – Handling all DOM events and interactivity

## File Overview 

index.html → HTML structure and element references
style.css → Styles for layout, colors, buttons, inputs
script.js → JavaScript for adding event listeners and dynamic behavior


## How It Works

1. When the user hovers over the button, its text and background change.
2. When the user clicks into the "Focus & Blur" input, its background changes and reverts on blur.
3. When the user types in the "Type something" input, the key they press is shown below in real time.
