# Our Team Web Page

This is a basic front-end project that displays a list of team members in a clean and responsive layout. The project is built using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — no external frameworks or libraries.

## Features:

- A header section with the title "Our Team"
- A "Refresh Team" button to reload the member cards
- Beautiful card layout using Flexbox
- Soft color gradients and shadows for a modern look
- Team data is loaded dynamically using JavaScript

## Files Overview:

- `index.html` – Contains the structure of the page
- `style.css` – Handles all visual styling, gradients, fonts, and layout
- `script.js` – Loads the team data and displays it as cards

## Tools & Technologies Used:

- **HTML5** – Page layout and elements
- **CSS3** – Styling with gradients, box shadows, transitions
- **JavaScript** – DOM manipulation and dynamic content rendering

## How It Works:

When the page loads:
1. JavaScript pulls team data from a simple array.
2. Each member is displayed in a styled card.
3. Clicking the **"Refresh Team"** button clears and reloads the same data.

## Future Ideas:

- Add images or avatars to cards  
- Include filtering/search by name or role  
- Animate cards as they load  
- Store team data externally (e.g., JSON or API)
