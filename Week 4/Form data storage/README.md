# Form Data Storage (Internship Task)

This is a simple front-end form application developed as part of my internship assignment. It allows users to enter their name, email, and a message. When the form is submitted, the data is saved in the browser’s `localStorage`, and shown directly below the form without reloading the page. This ensures that even if the page is refreshed, the saved data remains visible.

The design uses modern styling with a soft gradient background, glassmorphism card style, and responsive layout to support smaller screens. The main logic is written in vanilla JavaScript, and it handles form submission, local storage saving, and live content updates.

## Features

- Collects user name, email, and message
- Saves data using `localStorage` (no backend needed)
- Displays saved data immediately on the page
- Automatically shows saved data on page load
- Responsive design with clean UI (glass blur effect)

##  Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – for structure  
- **CSS3** – for layout, gradients, and styling  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – for form handling and localStorage logic

## File Overview

- `index.html` — contains form structure and script linking  
- `style.css` — styles the form and saved data area with modern design  
- `script.js` — handles form submission and localStorage integration
