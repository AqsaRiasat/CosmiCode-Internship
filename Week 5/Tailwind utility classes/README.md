# Tailwind Utility Demo – Internship Task

This project demonstrates the use of Tailwind CSS utility classes for spacing, typography, and color, along with custom styling and basic JavaScript interactivity. The project is cleanly separated into three files for maintainability and clarity.

---

## Project Structure

- index.html — Main HTML structure using Tailwind classes
- style.css — Custom font and background styles
- script.js — JavaScript file to add basic interactivity

---

## Features

### Tailwind CSS Utilities
- **Spacing**: Utility classes such as `p-8`, `mt-6`, `px-6` for consistent layout
- **Typography**: Font sizes, weight, tracking, and line height using Tailwind
- **Color**: Text and background color utilities with hover states

### Custom Styling
- Uses the Inter font via Google Fonts
- Soft background gradient and clean aesthetic
- Glassmorphism-style card with `backdrop-blur-md` and transparent background

### JavaScript Interactivity
- Clicking the “Get Started” button reveals a hidden success message
- Uses basic DOM manipulation and Tailwind animation class
